Project Title: **Sweet Shop Management System (TDD Kata)**

1. Introduction

The Sweet Shop Management System is a full‑stack web application developed as a TDD kata. The project focuses on building a clean, secure, and testable system that manages sweets, inventory, and users with proper authentication and authorization.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of backend API development, frontend SPA design, database integration, testing, and responsible use of AI tools.

2. Objectives

* Build a RESTful backend API
* Implement user authentication using JWT
* Manage sweets and inventory
* Develop a responsive frontend application
* Follow Test‑Driven Development (TDD)
* Maintain clean code and Git best practices
* Transparently use AI tools during development

3. Technology Stack

### Backend

* Node.js with TypeScript
* Express.js
* PostgreSQL Database
* JWT Authentication
* Jest & Supertest for testing

### Frontend

* React.js
* Axios for API calls
* CSS / Bootstrap for UI

### Tools

* Git & GitHub
* VS Code
* Postman

4. System Architecture

* REST API based architecture
* Client–Server model
* Layered backend structure:

  * Routes
  * Controllers
  * Services
  * Database models
* Frontend as a Single Page Application (SPA)

5. Functional Requirements

### User Module

* User registration
* User login
* Token‑based authentication

### Sweet Management

* Add new sweets (Admin)
* View all sweets
* Search sweets by name, category, or price
* Update sweet details (Admin)
* Delete sweets (Admin)

### Inventory Management

* Purchase sweets
* Automatically reduce quantity
* Restock sweets (Admin)

6. Non‑Functional Requirements

* Secure APIs using JWT
* Role‑based access (User / Admin)
* High test coverage
* Clean, readable, and maintainable code
* Responsive UI

7. Test‑Driven Development (TDD)

The project follows the Red‑Green‑Refactor approach:

1. Write failing test cases
2. Implement minimum logic to pass tests
3. Refactor code without breaking tests

### Tests Implemented

* Authentication tests
* Authorization tests
* Sweet CRUD tests
* Inventory purchase & restock tests
* Edge case handling

8. Git & Version Control

* Frequent commits
* Meaningful commit messages
* Feature‑based commits
* AI co‑author added where applicable

### Sample Commit Message

feat: Add inventory purchase functionality

Used AI tool to generate test structure, manually implemented logic and validations.

9. AI Usage Declaration

### AI Tools Used

* ChatGPT
* GitHub Copilot

### Usage Details

* Generated boilerplate code
* Assisted in writing unit tests
* Helped debug errors
* Improved documentation clarity

### Reflection

AI improved productivity and learning speed. All generated code was reviewed, understood, and customized by me.

10. Results

* All backend APIs implemented successfully
* Authentication and authorization working correctly
* Inventory logic handled accurately
* Frontend UI responsive and user‑friendly
* All tests passing

11. Future Enhancements

* Add payment gateway
* Add order history
* Improve UI animations
* Add role management dashboard

12. Conclusion

This project helped strengthen my understanding of full‑stack development, TDD, API security, and clean coding practices. The responsible use of AI tools enhanced productivity while maintaining code ownership and understanding.
